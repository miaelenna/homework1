What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

‘Git merge’ pulls in the latest changes from the main branch into a branch, creating a new merge commit in the process

‘Git rebase’ changes the base of a branch to the latest commit on main, and bases our changes from this version. This gives us a cleaner history.
